Short version in plain English

This is a short and simplified version of the license. However you are agreeing to the full version, so please read it.
If you are an individual or a company with annual revenue < $200,000 you qualify for the free indie license of the WADE engine.
This allows you to make games and non-games, for any purpose including selling and licensing, without paying anything to Clockwork Chilli. However you must not:

    Distribute non-compiled (or non-minified) versions of Clockwork Chilli's source code.
    Create a product that competes with WADE.

If you have a credits screen or credits sequence in your game or app, you must display the text "Powered by WADE (www.clockworkchilli.com)". Also please send us an email (or post in the forums at www.clockworkchilli.com) to let us know that you are releasing a product powered by WADE.

If you do not qualify, or find that any of these restrictions are unacceptable for you, please consider getting a license for WADE Pro, which also includes the full commented source code of the WADE engine.

Also please note that this license does not extend to any plug-in's or auxiliary modules for WADE, which will have their own license agreements.
